\begin{align}
  \lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{2\pi\bar{h}}{p}
\end{align}
This is the De Broglie wavelength. It applies to anything for which can have momentum; photons or massive particles. Can also be expressed as $\bar{h}$ which is a $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ factor of Planck's constant h.

The energy of a photon:
\begin{align}
  E_{photon}& = \bar{h} \omega = h \nu\\
  [\nu] &= 1/s
\end{align}
Also,
\begin{align}
  \omega& = 2\pi\nu\\
  \Rightarrow E_{photon}& = \bar{h}\omega = 2\pi\nu = h \nu
\end{align}

To gain measurable manifestations of wave-like properties, either reduce the mass of the particle or cool it down. Typically both.
